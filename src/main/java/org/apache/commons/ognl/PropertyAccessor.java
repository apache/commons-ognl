/**
 * This interface defines methods for setting and getting a property from a target object. A "property" in this case is
 * a named data value that takes the generic form of an Object---the same definition as is used by beans. But the
 * operational semantics of the term will vary by implementation of this interface: a bean-style implementation will get
 * and set properties as beans do, by reflection on the target object's class, but other implementations are possible,
 * such as one that uses the property name as a key into a map.
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this interface will often require that its target objects all be of some particular type. For
 * example, the MapPropertyAccessor class requires that its targets all implement the java.util.Map interface.
 * <p>
 * Note that the "name" of a property is represented by a generic Object. Some implementations may require properties'
 * names to be Strings, while others may allow them to be other types---for example, ArrayPropertyAccessor treats Number
 * names as indexes into the target object, which must be an array.
